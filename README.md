# PetProject

In this game, you have the ability to not only create your own pets, but also to interact with them and even make sure that they get to move on from your shelter (adoption). As time goes on, the pet statuses will be negatively affected by the passing of time (turns) that are displayed on the top of the console.

There are three main attributes to keep track of in this project (`Hunger`, `Boredom` and `Health`!)

To manage these attributes, you'll have the ability to feed your pets, play with your pets and take your pets to the doctor (mechanic for robots!) respectively. You can do so by either interacting with the entire group, or doing so on an individual basis. 

In the main menu, you'll see five main options to choose from

1.) Create a pet
	- This will allow you to create a new pet and specify whether you want them to be an organic pet or a robot. 
2.) View pet status
	- This selection will allow you to see all pet statuses in your shelter
3.) Interact with pet
	- This selection will allow you to interact with one pet in particular. (Play, feed, take to doctor) 
4.) Interact with group
	-This selection will allow you to interact with all pets at one time that are currently in your shelter. 
5.) Adoption
	-This selection will show all pets at your shelter, and allow you to remove them from your list. 

Side note, when interacting with the individual pet - ask them to speak! It was fun to play around with sound design.
